# Information Visualization - Group 48 Prototype

## How to Become an NBA Champion: Teams and Players Statistics 


To run this project, run a Python server in the root folder of the project. In Unix-based OS it can be done by using ***python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888*** .

The project was mainly developed and tested on **Firefox Browser 71.0 (64-bit)**. The use of any other browser might result in unexpected problems and unintended behavior.

The layout is **static** and **does not scale** with the browser's window size. If the screen resolution is too small, some elements (mainly the drop-down menus on the side of the year slider) might get out of position. A quick fix is to **zoom out** (90% of should be enough).

The project source code can also be found on https://github.com/ricardofbp/infoviz-prototype.
