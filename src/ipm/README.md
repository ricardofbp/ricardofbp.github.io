# IPM (Human-Machine Interaction) project 

Interface prototype for an (hypothetical) smartwatch to be used in festivals and concerts.
Missing the last functionality, which was a GPS marker and a parking lot system.
Done with Diogo Eusébio and Daniel Mendonça, during our 2nd year of the BS in Computer Science and Engineering at IST.
